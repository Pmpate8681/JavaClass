This project demonstrates the construction of a class in Java. A Student class that contains some instance data (Student's name, id, and GPA). The StudentObjects class contains an array of 5 student objects. Out of the 5 students, any that meet the GPA requirement are then added to an ArrayList called presidentsList.
